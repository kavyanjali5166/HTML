    <h1>More details about Manmohan Singh</h1>
    <p>Arrow;Manmohan Singh[a] (26 September 1932 – 26 December 2024) was an Indian politician, economist, academic, and bureaucrat, who served as the 13th prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He was the fourth longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi.[1] A member of the Indian National Congress, Singh was the first Sikh prime minister of India.[2] He was also the first prime minister since Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term.[3][4]

        Born in Gah in what is today Pakistan, Singh's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his doctorate in economics from the University of Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966–1969. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the Government of India, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of the Planning Commission (1985–1987).
        
        In 1991, as India faced a severe economic crisis, the newly elected prime minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as finance minister. Over the next few years, despite strong opposition, he carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India's economy. Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis, and enhanced Singh's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist, the incumbent Congress Party fared poorly in the 1996 general election. Subsequently, Singh was leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of 1998–2004.
        
        In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the prime ministership to Singh. His first ministry executed several key legislations and projects, including the National Rural Health Mission, Unique Identification Authority, Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and Right to Information Act. In 2008, opposition to a historic civil nuclear agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh's government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support.[5] In 2009, BRICS was established with India as one of the founding members.[6] India's economy grew rapidly during his term.[7][8]
        
        The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with an increased mandate, with Singh retaining the office of prime minister. Over the next few years, Singh's second ministry government faced a number of corruption charges over the organisation of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the 2G spectrum allocation case and the allocation of coal blocks. After his term ended, he opted out from the race for the office of prime minister during the 2014 Indian general election.[9] Singh was never a member of the Lok Sabha but served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, representing the state of Assam from 1991 to 2019 and Rajasthan from 2019 to 2024.[10][11]</p>
    <h1>Early life and education</h1>
    <p>Singh was born to Gurmukh Singh Kohli and Amrit Kaur on 26 September 1932, in Gah, Punjab, British India, into a family of Punjabi Sikh traders of Khatri background.[12][13] His mother died when he was very young.[14][15] He was raised by his paternal grandmother Jamna Devi, with whom he was very close.[12][15]

        Singh was initially educated at a local gurdwara, where he began studying Urdu and Punjabi.[16] On 17 April 1937, he was enrolled in the local Government Primary School, where he continued his Urdu-medium education until the age of 10 (Class 4), after which he and his family moved to Peshawar.[16][12][17] There, Singh was enrolled in the upper-primary Khalsa School.[16] Even as prime minister years later, Singh wrote his apparently Hindi speeches in the Urdu script, although sometimes he would also use Gurmukhi, a script used to write Punjabi, his mother tongue.[18] During the Partition of India, Singh and his family migrated to Haldwani, India.[14] His grandfather Sant Singh was brutally killed in the sectarian violence which erupted during Partition, an event that traumatised Singh throughout his life.[16] Consequently, he never returned to visit Gah despite pleas from local residents, as the village had greatly benefited from its connection to Singh following his election as prime minister of India.[16]
        
        In 1948, the family relocated to Amritsar, where Singh studied at Hindu College, Amritsar.[14][19] He attended Panjab University, then in Hoshiarpur,[20][21][22] Punjab, studying Economics and got his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1952 and 1954, respectively, standing first throughout his academic career. He completed his Economics Tripos at University of Cambridge in 1957. He was a member of St John's College.[23]
        
        In a 2005 interview with the British journalist Mark Tully, Singh said about his Cambridge days:
        
        I first became conscious of the creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor. Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher, but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students in a manner that very few others were able to achieve. She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining that the state has to play more of a role if you really want to combine development with social equity. Kaldor influenced me even more; I found him pragmatic, scintillating, stimulating. Joan Robinson was a great admirer of what was going on in China, but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to work.[24]
        
        After Cambridge, Singh returned to India and served as a teacher at Panjab University.[25] In 1960, he went to the University of Oxford for his DPhil, where he was a member of Nuffield College. His 1962 doctoral thesis under the supervision of Ian Little was titled "India's export performance, 1951–1960, export prospects and policy implications", and was later the basis for his book "India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth".[26]</p>

        After completing his D.Phil., Singh returned to India. He was a senior lecturer of economics at Panjab University from 1957 to 1959. During 1959 and 1963, he served as a reader in economics at Panjab University, and from 1963 to 1965, he was an economics professor there.[27] Then he went to work for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) from 1966 to 1969.[23] Later, he was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Trade by Lalit Narayan Mishra, in recognition of Singh's talent as an economist.[28]
        
        From 1969 to 1971, Singh was a professor of international trade at the Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi.[23][29]
        
        In 1972, Singh was chief economic adviser in the Ministry of Finance, and in 1976 he was secretary in the Finance Ministry.[23] In 1980–1982 he was at the Planning Commission, and in 1982, he was appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of India under then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and held the post until 1985.[23] He went on to become the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission (India) from 1985 to 1987.[13] Following his tenure at the Planning Commission, he was secretary general of the South Commission, an independent economic policy think tank headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland from 1987 to November 1990.[30]
        
        Singh returned to India from Geneva in November 1990 and held the post as the advisor to Prime Minister of India on economic affairs during the tenure of Chandra Shekar.[23] In March 1991, he became chairman of the University Grants Commission.[23]</p>

    <h1>Political career</h1>
    <p>In June 1991, India's prime minister at the time, P. V. Narasimha Rao, chose Singh to be his finance minister. Singh told Mark Tully, a British journalist, in 2005:
    On the day (Rao) was formulating his cabinet, he sent his Principal Secretary to me saying, "The PM would like you to become the Minister of Finance". I didn't take it seriously. He eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing in. So that's how I started in politics[.][25]</p>
    <h3>Minister of Finance(1991-1996)</h3>
    <p>In 1991, India's fiscal deficit was close to 8.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, the balance of payments deficit was huge and the current account deficit was close to 3.5 per cent of India's GDP.[31] India's foreign reserves barely amounted to US$1 billion, enough to pay for 2 weeks of imports,[32] in comparison to US$600 billion in 2009.[33]

        Singh explained to the PM and the party that India is facing an unprecedented crisis.[32] However the rank and file of the party resisted deregulation.[32] So P. Chidambaram and Singh explained to the party that the economy would collapse if it was not deregulated.[32] To the dismay of the party, Rao allowed Singh to deregulate the Indian economy.[32]
        
        Subsequently, Singh, who had thus far been one of the most influential architects of India's socialist economy, eliminated the permit raj,[32] reduced state control of the economy, and reduced import taxes.[31][34] Rao and Singh thus implemented policies to open up the economy and change India's socialist economy to a more capitalistic one, in the process dismantling the License Raj, a system that inhibited the prosperity of private businesses. They removed many obstacles standing in the way of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and initiated the process of the privatisation of public sector companies. However, in spite of these reforms, Rao's government was voted out in 1996 due to the government's non-performance in other areas. In praise of Singh's work that pushed India towards a market economy, long-time Cabinet minister P. Chidambaram has compared Singh's role in India's reforms to Deng Xiaoping's in China.[35]
        
        In 1993, Singh offered his resignation from the post of Finance Minister after a parliamentary investigation report criticised his ministry for not being able to anticipate a US$1.8 billion 1992 securities scandal. Prime Minister Rao refused Singh's resignation, instead promising to punish the individuals directly accused in the report.[36]
        
        Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha (1998–2004)
        Singh was first elected to the upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, in 1991[37] by the legislature of the state of Assam, and was re-elected in 1995, 2001, 2007[13] and 2013.[38] From 1998 to 2004, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, Singh was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. In 1999, he contested for the Lok Sabha from South Delhi but was unable to win the seat in his electoral debut.[39]</p>
        <h3>Prime Minister (2004–2014)</h3>
        <p>
            11th President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam authorising the Prime Minister designate Manmohan Singh to form the next Government in New Delhi on 19 May 2004
            After the 2004 general elections, the Indian National Congress ended the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) tenure by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. It formed the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with allies and staked the claim to form government. In a surprise move, Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared Manmohan Singh, a technocrat, as the UPA candidate for the prime ministership. Despite the fact that Singh had never won a direct popular election, he, according to the BBC, "enjoyed massive popular support, not least because he was seen by many as a clean politician untouched by the taint of corruption that has run through many Indian administrations."[40] He took the oath as the Prime Minister of India on 22 May 2004.[41][42]</p>
